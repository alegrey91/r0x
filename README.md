# r0x

r0x is a network scanner written in python.
It use the python-nmap library which is a wrapper for nmap.
The purposes of this tool are the pluggable scripts wrote in bash.
These simple scripts contains just few raw of command such as: `nikto -host $host`.
The reason why I decided to develop this tool is about the information gathering,
which is the most important phase of the penetration test.
Many time I missed a detail that could have been funtamental for the success of the exploitation.
P.S. The name is due to a collegue of mine, considered one of the last real hacker out there. Is name is Rosario.
