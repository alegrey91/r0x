# r0x

r0x is a network scanner written in python.</br>
It use the python-nmap library which is a wrapper for nmap.</br>
The purposes of this tool are the pluggable scripts wrote in bash.</br>
These simple scripts contains just few raw of command such as: `nikto -host $host`.</br>
The reason why I decided to develop this tool is about the information gathering,
which is the most important phase of the penetration test.</br>
Many time I missed a detail that could have been funtamental for the success of the exploitation.</br>
P.S. The name is due to a collegue of mine, considered one of the last real hacker out there.</br> 
His name is Rosario.
